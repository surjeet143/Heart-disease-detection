# Heart-disease-detection
Machine Learning algorithms can be used for medical diagnose. In this repository, I have built a Machine Learning algorithm to detect heart disease with some features. I have fetched this data from the https://www.drivendata.org/ competition. We have performed some operations to clean the data, label encoder for categorical columns, transformations, etc. The algorithm will help physicians to diagnose whether heart disease is present or not.
The project includes mainly two models, logistic regression and random forest. The model has been deployed with help of flask.
