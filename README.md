# Heart-disease-detection
Machine Learning algorithms can be used to medical diagnose. In this repsotary I have build a Machine Learning algorithm to detect the heart disease with some features. I have fetched this data from the https://www.drivendata.org/ competetion. We will perform some operations to clean the data, lebel encoder for catagorical columns, transformations etc. The algorithm will help to physicians to dignose whether the heart disease is persent of not.
