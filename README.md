# Heart-disease-detection
Machine Learning algorithms can be used for medical diagnose. In this repository, I have built a Machine Learning algorithm to detect heart disease with some features. I have fetched this data from the https://www.drivendata.org/ competition. We will perform some operations to clean the data, label encoder for categorical columns, transformations, etc. The algorithm will help physicians to diagnose whether heart disease is present or not.
